#eCommerce Website using Vue.js

#What is Vue?

- Vue (or Vue.js) is an open-source front-end JavaScript framework.
- Vue is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller).
- Vue is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries/frameworks.

In this section we have created a basic HTML file and add a link to a Vue CDN in the head, and create a <div> with an id of app.

#Basic Steps

1. Create index.html file.
2. Include Vue with:
<!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>

		OR

<!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
